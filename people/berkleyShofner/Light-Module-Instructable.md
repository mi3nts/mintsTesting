# **Getting to know the light module:**

### **A. Getting the IDE Ready**

1. Install Atom: https://atom.io/ and https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/
2. Go to the settings page (Crtl+Comma) and go to the +Install tab at the bottom.
3. Search for "platformio" and install the 4 packages made by platformio: 
  - platformio-idle 
  - platformio-idle-debugger
  - platformio-idle-terminal
  - platformio-aia
4. If any errors appear while installing these packages, there should be a link at the top right in the error message itself that will give you step by step instrutions on fixing the errors.

### **B. Creating First File**

1. Open up Atom and go to the "PlatformIO Home" page.
2. Click on "+ New Project" and name the project (making sure to not use any spaces).
3. Click on the board option and type in "nano". Select the board "Arduino Nano ATmega328 (New Bootloader)", keep the framework as "Arduino", and click Finish.
4. There should now be a Project tab to the right of Atom with your one project folder in it.
5. To get to the c++ file, click on the "srs" folder under your project folder and click on "main.cpp".
